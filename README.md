# Employee Turnover Analytics

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is a comprehensive tool for analyzing employee turnover. It utilizes popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn. The notebook begins by importing these libraries, setting up a robust environment for data manipulation and visualization. 

The core of the analysis involves a dataset on human resources, which is read into a Pandas DataFrame. Initial exploration of this data is conducted through basic methods like `head()` and `shape`, providing an overview of the dataset structure and dimensions. 

This tool is designed to offer insights into employee turnover by applying data analysis and machine learning techniques. It's suitable for HR departments looking to understand and predict employee turnover trends, making it an invaluable resource for strategic human resource planning.

## Usage
To use this notebook:
1. Clone or download the repository containing the Jupyter notebook.
2. Ensure all required libraries are installed.
3. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
4. Run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis or modify as needed for custom analysis.

## Data
The analysis is based on an HR dataset, possibly containing employee demographics, job characteristics, and turnover information. Ensure the dataset is in the correct format (e.g., Excel or CSV) and modify the data import step if the format differs.
